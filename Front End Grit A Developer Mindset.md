# A Developer Mindset

### Don't be fruastrated

Learning by doing is the best way to learn coding. It's very common to get 
stuck in a project. Don't be frustrated when you meet difficulties. 

#### Try these 3 specific tactics.

- When you hit a problem, check your thoughts. If they sound anything like 
“I’m so stupid, I’ll never get this” or “Everyone else is lightyears ahead, 
I’ll never get paid to do this”, change your thoughts to questions instead. 
For example: what can I learn from this? How can I improve?

- Don’t tally up successes and setbacks. Instead, focus on all the things 
that you learned that day and imagine all the things you will learn 
tomorrow.

- Instead of comparing yourself to people who are farther along, think 
about how hard those people had to work to get where they are today.

### Ask questions and solve problems

Other people are likely to have the same problem with you. Feel free to ask 
questions,which is more efficient than study alone.

#### Try asking question in these places

- Google

- Stack Overflow

- Udacity forums

- Your learning partner
